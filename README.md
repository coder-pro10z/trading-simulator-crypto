# Crypto Trading Simulator (Python) 🐍

A real-time cryptocurrency trading simulator that connects to CoinMarketCap's WebSocket feed to test trading strategies with live price data. Perfect for backtesting algorithms and learning trading concepts without financial risk.

## Token Compatibility

**Important**: This simulator only works with tokens/contracts that are available on CoinMarketCap's DEX platform.

### **How to Check Token Availability:**
1. Visit: `https://dex.coinmarketcap.com/token/solana/CONTRACT_ADDRESS/`
2. Replace `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with your target token's contract address
3. If the page loads with trading data, the token is supported
4. If you get a 404 or no data, the token won't work with this simulator


## Features ✨

- **Real-time Data**: Live price feeds from CoinMarketCap WebSocket
- **Smart Trading Logic**: Automated buy/sell decisions based on price movements  
- **Risk Management**: Stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: P&L tracking, win rates, and trade history
- **Auto-reconnection**: Handles network interruptions gracefully
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper portfolio valuation on exit

## Trading Strategy 📈

### **Buy Conditions:**
- **Initial Buy**: Invest $100 with first price received
- **3% Recovery Buy**: Re-enter when price recovers 3% from last sell
- **10% Fall Reinvest**: Dollar-cost average on significant dips

### **Sell Conditions:**
- **5% Stop Loss**: Automatically cut losses to preserve capital
- **10% Take Profit**: Lock in gains at target levels

### **Key Features:**
- Uses remaining balance after each trade (realistic compounding)
- Tracks unrealized P&L for open positions
- Calculates final portfolio value using last known price

## Configuration ⚙️

Modify trading parameters in the code:

```python
# In TradingSimulator.__init__()
self.initial_investment = 100.0      # Starting amount ($)
self.runtime_minutes = 10            # How long to run

# Trading thresholds
self.sell_loss_threshold = 0.05      # 5% stop loss
self.sell_profit_threshold = 0.10    # 10% take profit
self.reinvest_fall_threshold = 0.10  # 10% reinvest trigger
self.buy_up_threshold = 0.03         # 3% recovery buy

```


**Happy Learning! 📈 (Virtually, of course!)**

_I haven't included actual buy and sell functions so impulse traders don't hop on and start risking their capital. Determined traders can do the hard work themselves and add buy-sell functions; it's not that difficult. Maybe rewrite this in Rust for faster performance._
